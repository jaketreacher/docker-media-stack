## Instructions

Docker has known networking limitations on MacOS and Windows.  
Therefore, it is best to run this on **Linux**.

### Requirements
- docker
- docker-compose

### Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and make the relevant changes
2. Start all containers: `docker-compose up -d`

### Configuration
Given each service in running inside a container, the paths are relative to the container and not to the host.  

#### Deluge
- Download to: `/downloads` 
- Enable the `Label` plugin  

#### Sonarr/Radarr
- When adding Jackett as an Indexer, use the url `jackett:9117` rather than `localhost:9117`
- When adding Deluge as a Download Client, use the host `172.17.0.1`  

#### Plex
- Initial setup: Browse to `http://localhost:32400/web`
- Subsequent use: Plex will be acccessible from `https://app.plex.tv/desktop`
- Movies: `/media/movies`
- TV Shows: `/media/series`

## Troubleshooting
### Plex Transcoding Issues
If Docker creates the `trancode` directory on the host, the permissions will be set to `root:root` and therefore Plex will not have access to it. Ensure this directory is owned by your host user and it will work.
